    <td>I learned by taking down notes about hex as it was a new subject for me. This meant that when I went to do questions on hex I was able to do them without having to look up how to do it.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that because we had done binary before I felt that I could do it quickly and without really thinking which led to me making careless errors.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>Next time I need to take care when doing binary questions to make sure that I don't make any silly mistakes and so that I can improve on the speed that I can complete binary questions with.</td>
