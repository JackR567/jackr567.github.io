  <tr>
    <td>I learned by using the internet because although I listened to everything we were told about ascii I did not fully understand about it so I used the internet to look it up and get further knowledge on how it works so I could use that knowledge when making the converter.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I felt that the fact that I had no knowledge on ascii and also the fact that recently we had been doing binary and hex meant that I got slightly confused about it.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I am going to think through the details of it very slowly so that I do not get confused about it and then I will learn it much better than if i rush through it.</td>
