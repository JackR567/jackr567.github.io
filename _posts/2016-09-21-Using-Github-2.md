    <td>Taking notes down so that I didn't forget anything was an effective strategy that I used. Also only changing one section of code at a time was effective because it meant that if something went wrong then I would know which section was causing the problem.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>Trying not to ask other people for help too much because it means that I am not always learning how to do things and figuring out how to solve the problem by myself.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to see if I can figure out the problem myself and not ask the teacher or my classmates for help too much. Also make sure that my notes are always clear because sometimes I don't always make my notes clear enough.</td>
