  <tr>
    <td>Effective strategies that I used were working together with the person I was sitting next to so that with us both going through the steps we were less likely to make a mistake or miss something out. Also, working carefully rather than just rushing through it was also a good idea because again I was less likely to miss something

    <td>If I am going to go through the work with somebody else then I need to make sure that the conversation is always about the work because I feel that if i had done that then i would've been able to completely finish my blog rather than having to do some of it for homework. Also, when being told what I need to do, take notes so that I don’t forget anything.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Take my iPad with me when we are going to be told what we need to do so that I can take notes and then I won’t forget anything or miss anything out. Also, plan what I am going to write rather than just putting down something on the page because I felt like at times I was having to go back and rewrite some bits.</td>
